Data Cleaning 
	concat training and test data 
	missing values
	categorical feature processing 
		convert numerical to categorical others 
		ordinal encoding 
		general one hot encoding

	scaler before penalization normalize / standardize 


	pipeline 

Models 
	linear regression 
	lasso 
	ridge 
	elastic 
	random forest and gradient boosting
	bayes 
	xg boost 

feature engineering 
	➢ Either by adding brand new features from outside sources
	➢ Or adding new features derived from the original features
	➢ Or using such new features to replace the original features
	➢ Eliminate any unnecessary features
	➢ Eliminate multicolinear features - basement area TotRmsAbvGrd 


	heat map 

Models 
	elastic model - ifor loop for lambda and alpha


Cross validation - ml flow / grid search


Stack
	stack linear ramdom forest sg boost - overfit - last step

Presentation

why do we choose this model? pesuade the audiance  

model selection
	1. scatterplot - linear regression 
	2. residual plot/ after fitting the regression (r slr) 
	3. quantile-quantile plot
